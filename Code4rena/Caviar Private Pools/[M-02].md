# The flashFee function is not implemented to spec

## Impact

Flash loans will always be taken in a way that does not bring almost any yield to the poolâ€™s owner.

## Proof of Concept

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L748-L752](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L748-L752)

Based on the NatSpec documentation, unused parameters, and the minimal function body, it appears that the function was not implemented as intended.

Unlike the other three fee-calculating functions, this particular function does not consider the NFT weightings and amount in its logic.

At present, the function only generates a flat **`changeFee`**, without taking into account any information regarding the state of the reserves or the weighting of the NFT.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing the function in the way it was supposed to be implemented in.
