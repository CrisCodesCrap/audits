# The transfer of ERC20 prizes may fail without reverting, resulting in the funds becoming locked

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert when a transaction fails, resulting in users' funds being locked and inaccessible to them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The claimERC20Prize() function can have unpredictable behavior or cause fund loss because some ERC20 tokens do not revert or return 0 upon transfer failure.

The **`claimERC20Prize()` @** function does not include a check to ensure that the token transfer was successful. This means that if a transfer fails, the ERC20 tokens will still be marked as claimed from the PrizeDistributor contract, even though the user did not receive them.

## Impact

This causes the funds of user to be locked and made inaccessible to them.

```solidity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider modifying the specified line to mitigate the potential vulnerability.[\*\*[FootiumPrizeDistributor/L130]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130)\*\*
to:

```solidity
require(_token.transfer(_to, value), "Token transfer failed.");
```

Implementing this change will effectively eliminate the potential vulnerability.
